  journal = {Advances in Computers},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {69},
  pages = {243--295},
  abstract = {The focus of this chapter is to review what is known about free and
	open source software development (FOSSD) work practices, development
	processes, project and community dynamics, and other socio-technical
	relationships. It does not fo- cus on specific properties or technical
	attributes of different FOSS systems, but it does seek to explore
	how FOSS is developed and evolved. The chapter provides a brief background
	on what FOSS is and how free software and open source soft- ware
	development efforts are similar and different. From there attention
	shifts to an extensive review of a set of empirical studies of FOSSD
	that articulate dif- ferent levels of analysis. These characterize
	what has been analyzed in FOSSD studies across levels that examine
	why individuals participate; resources and ca- pabilities supporting
	development activities; how cooperation, coordination, and control
	are realized in projects; alliance formation and inter-project social
	net- working; FOSS as a multi-project software ecosystem, and FOSS
	as a social movement. Following this, the chapter reviews how different
	research methods are employed to examine different issues in FOSSD.
	These include reflective practice and industry polls, survey research,
	ethnographic studies, mining FOSS repositories, and multi-modal modeling
	and analysis of FOSSD processes and socio-technical networks. Finally,
	there is a discussion of limitations and con- straints in the FOSSD
	studies so far, attention to emerging opportunities for future FOSSD
	studies, and then conclusions about what is known about FOSSD through
	the empirical studies reviewed here.},

  abstract = {{In recent years, consumer oriented information systems development
	has become increasingly important matter, as more and more complex
	information systems are targeted towards consumer markets. We argue
	that developing IS for non-organizational users creates new problems,
	which IS and requirement engineering (RE) community should attend
	to.First of all, the elicitation of requirements becomes more difficult
	as usually consumers do not explicitly know what they want, and it
	is difficult for them to express their ideas. To support different
	views of product development, such as project management and design,
	the method should present requirements in a rich enough' way to avoid
	overloading management, but in the same time giving designers the
	detailed information they need. Last but not the least, theresults
	of requirements engineering should be easy to integrate to the software
	development process. To this end, we have constructed a new RE method
	and its support environment within Metaedit+ Meta CASE tool. We based
	our method on Critical Success Chains (CSC) method, which supports
	top-down approach for planning, but also provides for wide participation
	of IS customers to get rich information. CSC aggregates the results
	of many individual interviews into meaningful graphical models of
	what is critically important about a potential system. In our work,
	CSC is extended with customer segmentation and lead user concepts
	from marketing.}},
